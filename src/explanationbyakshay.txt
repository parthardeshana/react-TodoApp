we try to keep original data in state and all the derived data from state is computed
during render



let arr = [1,2,[3,4], [[5]], ["x", 6], [7, '7']])

function findSum(arr) {
    //returns sum of the numbers present in array
    // here it is 28
    tempvar =0 ;

    map.
    if(e == isnumber ){
    tempvar = tempvar + e;
    }
}
